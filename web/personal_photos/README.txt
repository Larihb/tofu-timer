# üì∏ Personal Photos Directory

This is where you add your own meaningful photos for the reward system!

## üéÅ How It Works

Every time you complete 1 hour of focused work, Tofu Timer will show you one of your personal photos as a reward. This creates a meaningful connection between your productivity and the things that matter most to you.

## üìÅ Adding Your Photos

1. **Add your photos to this folder**
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF
   - Recommended size: 400x400px or smaller
   - Any aspect ratio works!

2. **Name your photos**
   - Use the format: `photo1.jpg`, `photo2.jpg`, `photo3.jpg`, etc.
   - The app will cycle through them in order
   - You can have as many as you want!

3. **Update the code (optional)**
